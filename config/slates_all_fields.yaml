  I have an image containing information about a TV show or movie.

  I need you to extract the following information from the image and generate it as JSON:

  program-title

  title
  episode-no
  create-date
  air-date
  date
  director

  camera

  Important Notes:
  - Not all of these keys will necessarily be present in the image.
  - The image may contain other information not listed above.
  - Only include the values for the keys listed above that are actually found in the image.
  - If a key is not found, do not include it in the JSON output.

  Example JSON Output:
